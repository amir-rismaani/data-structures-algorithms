# Tree

- A linked list is actually a form of a tree. It's just a tree that doesn't fork.
- A binary tree is going to have tow arrows, so this is going to look.
- A binary tree have a left and right arrow. There's no rule that a tree has to be binary, you could have it point to three items or 10 items or however many you want.

# Terminology

- **Full tree:** every item either points to two nodes or zero nodes.
- **Perfect tree:** every line is completely filled all the way across.
- **Complete tree:** every item either points to one nodes or two node or zero nodes.

So a perfect tree will always be full. It will always be complete.

- **Parent:** Every child node has one and only one parent. You can't have more than one parent in a tree.
- **Children:** Child node can also be parents of two nodes.
- **Leaf:** A node that doesn't have any children is called a leaf.
- **Siblings:** Two children, because they have the same parent, are also called siblings.
