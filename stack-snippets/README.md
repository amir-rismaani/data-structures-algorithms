# Stack

Here, stack is created using a linked list.

## Terminology

When we add something to a stack, we say that pushing an item onto the stack. And if we remove it, that is called popping an item from a stack.
Only item can be removed is this one. This is called `LIFO (**L**ast **I**n **F**irst **O**ut)`.
