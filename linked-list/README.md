# Linked List 
Linked list have a variable called **`head`** that points to the first item and one called **`tail`**, that points to the last item. Then each item in the linked list points to the next. The last item points to null that commonly called `null terminated`.

## Linked List vs Array
- One of the things that array have that linked list don't, are indexes.
- Arrays are in contiguous places in memory, but linked lists aren't they can be all over the place.
